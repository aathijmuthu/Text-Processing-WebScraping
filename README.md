# Text-Processing-WebScraping


Webscraped wikipedia articles of the 2020 presidential candidates to analyze the sentiment of the articles. Scraped using Beautiful Soup, then processed the data to remove stop words, and finally performed a sentiment analysis on each sentence to produce a final sentiment score for each candidate.
