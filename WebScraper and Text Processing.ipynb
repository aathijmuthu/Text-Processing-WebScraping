    "My question is which president as a greater positive correlation with a sentiment analysis and counting word frequency. A residual question of whether Wikipedia (a website solely based on facts not opinion) has biases when describing Trump or Biden can be answered with this sentiment analysis as well. I will be performing webscraping on two Wikipedia sites, one about Trump and another about Biden. Then I will clean the data to only include sentences with either Trump or Biden. I will find out what word is most frequent in both texts. Then I will perform a sentiment analysis and find the mean of the compound score and compare the scores of the two political figures.\n"

    "As we can see, Trump's compound sentiment score from all of the Wikipedia page's sentences is overall negative. Meanwhile we can see that Biden's compound sentiment score from all of the Wikipedia page's sentences is overall positive. This can mean many different things. It can show that Trump is a more controversial president since Wikipedia shows a stronger negative connotation with his actions. It can also show that Wikipedia might not be completely impartial when stating the facts since there is a somewhat significant difference between the two president's scores. However I don't think this claim about Wikipedia is substantial since both compound scores are close to 0. This means that Wikipedia was mostly impartial when describing both presidents. Thus, using the data I gathered, I can assert that Biden's actions are described in a more positive manner when compared to Trump."
